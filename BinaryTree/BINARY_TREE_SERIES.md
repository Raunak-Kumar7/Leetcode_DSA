# Striver Binary Tree

### L1: Introduction & Types of Binary Trees

### L2: Representation of Binary Tree

### L5: PreOrder Traversal (DFS) - LC144
Recursive + Iterative + Morris Traversal

### L6: Inorder Traversal (DFS) - LC94
Recursive + Iterative + Morris Traversal

### L7: Postorder Traversal (DFS) - LC145
Recursive + Iterative

### L8: Level Order Traversal (BFS) 

Questions Based on Concept:
LC102 - Level Order Traversal
LC103 - Binary Tree Zigzag Level Order Traversal
LC107 - Level Order Traversal2 (Bottom up)
LC429 - N-ary Tree Level Order Traversal
LC637 - Average of Levels in Binary Tree
LC1161 - Maximum Level Sum of a Binary Tree
LC2583 - Kth Largest Sum in a Binary Tree
LC2415 - Reverse Odd Levels of Binary Tree
**LC2471** - 
LC1302 - Deepest Leaves Sum
G - Left View of a Binary Tree
L199 - Binary Tree Right Side View
LC116 - Populate Next Right Pointers 1 (Also try recursive (dfs) Approach)
