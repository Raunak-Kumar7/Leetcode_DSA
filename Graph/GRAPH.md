#### [Representation of a Graph]

#### BFS (Connected + Disconnected)

#### DFS (Connected + Disconnected)

## Matrix Based Ques 
#### Number of Connected Components Concept
LC547 - Number of Provinces (BFS+DFS)
LC200 - Number of Islands (BFS+DFS)
LC1254 - Number of Closed island (BFS + DFS)(Number of island + Boundary )
LC1905 - Count Sub Islands (BFS + DFS)
LC733 - Flood Fill (BFS+DFS)


LC463 - Island Perimeter
LC994 - Rotting Oranges(minimum time to rot fresh oranges) (BFS only)
LC130 - Surrounded Regions(BFS+DFS)
LC542 - 0/1 Matrix
CN(LC286) - Walls and Gates (same as 0/1 matrix)(minimum distance) (BFS only)
LC1765 - Map of highest Peak (BFS only, minimum height/dist)
LC1162 - As Far From Land as Possible (BFS only, maximum of all minimum distances)
LC1926 - Nearest Exit From Entrance in A maze (BFS only, minimum distance)
LC1992 - Find All Groups of Farmland(BFS+DFS)
G(LC694) - Number of Distinct Islands ( BFS + DFS) ( store shape in Set + subtract Base)
LC1020 - Number of Enclaves (Multisource) ( Boundary element components)
LC419 - BattleShips on Boards (dfs)
LC1559 - Detect Cycles in a 2D grid (BFS + DFS) (already visited and not a parent --> cycle, keep parent also)

#### Cycle Detection in Undirected Graph
Using BFS
Using DFS
LC1034 - Coloring A border(BFS + DFS) (MATRIX)
