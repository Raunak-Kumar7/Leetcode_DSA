#### [Representation of a Graph]

#### BFS (Connected + Disconnected)
LC1091 - Shortest Path in Binary Matrix(keeping count in Vis array)
(shortest --> only BFS)
LC2101 - Detonate the Maximum Bombs



#### DFS (Connected + Disconnected)
LC129 - Sum Root To Leaf Numbers
LC112 - Path Sum1 (in trees)
LC988 - Smallest String Starting From Leaf(in trees)


LC841 - Keys and Rooms(BFS, DFS(do))
LC1376 - Time Needed To Inform All Employees(BFS(do),DFS)
## Matrix Based Ques 
#### Number of Connected Components Concept

#### Cycle Detection in Undirected Graph
Using BFS
Using DFS
LC1034 - Coloring A border(BFS + DFS) (MATRIX)

#### Cycle Detection in Directed Graph
Using DFS
Using BFS (Find Topo Sort: if size !=V  cycle  )
LC802 - Find Eventual Safe State (DFS(Cycle detection in Directed), BFS(Topo Sort))
LC207 - Course Schedule1 (BFS(do) + DFS)


LC785 - Bipartite Graph(BFS+DFS)



#### Topological Sort
Using DFS (Also keep a stack and push while returning --> stack has ans)
Using BFS(Kahn's Algorithm) (Instead of VISITED keep INDEGREE Array)
LC 2192 - All ancestors of a Node in a Directed Acyclic Graph(BFS + DFS(do))
LC2115 - Find All Possible Recipes from Given Supplies(BFS + DFS(do))
